have over a 70% chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer during their life. While the
mortality rate of breast cancer has been declining over the past 40 years, BRCA1 breast cancer
remains highly aggressive and difficult to treat, underscoring the importance of determining early
events that occur prior to overt tumour formation in the mammary glands of females with BRCA1
mutations.

In pre-malignant BRCA1 tissue, there is a high ratio of progenitor cells, and it is these cells that are
the cell-of-origin for BRCA1 tumours. Progenitor cells isolated from females with BRCA1
mutations have increased proliferative potential and fail to differentiate correctly. In mammary
epithelial cells, BRCA1 regulates the direction of cell divisions, which dictates the fate and
function of these cells. In this way, BRCA1 may be required to govern cell fate and maintain
homeostasis in the mammary gland. My research investigates how BRCA1 mutation disrupts
periods of cellular growth and differentiation in the mammary gland, such as during pregnancy and
lactation, and if these changes have the potential to promote tumourigenesis.
","I am open to mentoring students through any research project in the field of mammary gland
development and/or breast cancer. The research topic does not have to be in my specific field of
research, as long as I feel I am able to help guide my group through the project and everyone is
interested in the subject, I am open to it.

I have been a REX mentor for the past three years, and I have structured each year the same way.
We begin with an introductory meeting where we discuss the research interests of the group and
potential topics. After this introductory meeting, each member of the group will do a brief
literature review and come up with potential research questions that we then go over at the next
meeting to finalize our field of research.

Following these initial meetings, we then go over how to conduct a proper literature review and finalize
our research question. Everyone in the group will work together on the literature review, and once
the literature review is finished, I review it with the group and provide my feedback before
submission. After the literature review, we will then go over methodology to answer our research
question, and how to compose an abstract and poster for the undergraduate conference. I review
the abstract and poster in the same way that I review the literature review, and provide my
feedback to the group and to each individual.

Throughout the year, I typically meet with my group every few weeks for 1-2 hours and am always
available via email or zoom calls for extra help.

Fruit color is a key quality characteristics as it drives consumer preference and market acceptability. Genes involved in color determination have been previously reported. However, for fruit with red color it is not possible to discriminate their genetic background on the basis of observable characteristics. This makes it difficult to choose cultivars/selections to include in breeding programs based off their fruit color. 
A. agathonica represents a major concern to producers in North America, since it is an efficient vector of viruses that have been associated with the Raspberry mosaic. This disease can cause plant and yield decline, as well as detrimental effects on fruit quality. To date, several resistance genes have been identified, but there remains the need to combine more than one resistance gene in new cultivars, in order to build a solid resistance mechanism against the large raspberry aphid.
The project encompasses a number of disciplines, including breeding, biochemistry, fruit quality and entomology.","I have in mind to introduce my mentees to plant breeding, its principles and, above all, to instill in them interest in sustainable horticulture.

It is not a job that pays well, and it is not often associated with success. As young adults, it is hard to know what you should do with your life and we often find ourselves picking a job like we are picking off an item from a set menu. In reality, there are more options, we just aren’t exposed to them. This is what research offers– a way to find your own path for something you really care about. 

I am a multidisciplinary researcher currently doing research at the intersection of wildfires, carbon emissions, and Indigenous Studies. That being said, I am mostly interested in actionable change that leads to a more sustainable world. 

My question for you: What do you think the world needs?","Knowledge is never-ending meaning that there are always more things to know. There are many types of knowledge and science is an effective and organized way to acquire knowledge. Unfortunately, science prioritizes observation and understanding of current events over actionable changes. We try to understand something fully before we do anything about it. In some fields, such as medicine, this is a wise approach. However, in some other fields, observations can only tell you so much. I argue that this is the case for sustainability and the environment.

There are thousands of studies reporting about the effects of climate change, and modelling the future of climate change. Truth is, the models are just models, and wise scientists will admit that they just don’t know the long-term effects of climate change. These studies are important because they highlight the need to do something, but a relative minority of studies observe actual solutions that are being implemented.
My intention as a mentor is to support mentees in nurturing their critical thinking skills, thinking about what their idea of a sustainable future looks like, and developing a project/research proposal toward that goal. Any topic that focuses on actionable change for sustainability is on the table. If you have an idea, bring it with you, if not, we can figure it out together!

Examples of projects:
1. Understanding issues surrounding recycling such as sorting and collection and suggesting a pilot project to solve some of these issues. 
2. Understanding what sustainable eating looks like and suggesting easy-to-implement behavioural changes for people. 

Whatever it might be, we can strategize on how to employ the scientific method to gather knowledge surrounding an issue of sustainability that YOU care about. We will employ engineering principles of systems thinking to build a map of where the problem you have identified is located within society, identify root causes, and suggest solutions.
My mentees can either share a project or work on their own. In all cases, they will be working together to bounce ideas off each other.

Remote sensing is the field of science that deals with measuring light from distance to quantify various physical properties of the earth. One application of remote sensing is the quantification of forest carbon across large spatial scales (e.g., across all of BC). Currently, remote sensing-based forest carbon models are fairly reliable, however there are many sources of error and uncertainty in our predictions. As such, research is ongoing to improve the reliability of remote sensing-based forest carbon models.  In my case, I primarily use data consisting of satellite imagery and airborne (plane or drone) light detection and ranging data (LiDAR) to model forest carbon. I specifically develop deep learning (artificial intelligence) models that can generate forest carbon predictions in an end-to-end fashion directly from LiDAR and satellite imagery data. This approach involves the use of models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Other general aspects of my research include areas such as allometry, data fusion, general machine learning, statistics, model explainability, and forest carbon dynamics. ","I plan to help a student develop a project that uses remote sensing derived variables to estimate some form of phenomena related to their interests. I am very flexible and open to any sort of project that relates remote sensing variable X to target response variable Y. There are over 1,000 remote sensing satellites currently in orbit around earth, not including terminated missions. These sensors, in addition to concluded missions, have collected data going back to the 1960s and further. With this deluge of big data, there is a vast array of research questions we can answer using these datasets. For example, how does greenness measured from satellite imagery predict socioeconomic status in the British Columbia lower mainland? Another example might be: how does forest structural complexity predict caribou habitat in Alberta? I am most familiar with biology, ecology, and forestry, but am certainly open to social science applications of remote sensing as well. For example, I have done work in the past on urban forestry topics such as the relationship between greenspace and welfare housing outcomes.  I work on a great deal of programming in R and Python languages for my research and am able to help students develop programming skills if they are interested.

To achieve this, I employ various electrical stimulation techniques to investigate different segments of the pathway, including cortical, spinal, and peripheral components. By doing this, I can assess the integrity and functionality of each segment, identifying where the main cause of the increased fatigue is. This comprehensive approach allows for a detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying muscle fatigue in SCI.

2. Data Extraction and Analysis: The selected studies will be reviewed to extract relevant data, including the types of forecasting methods used, the features or variables included, the evaluation metrics employed, and the overall performance of the models.

3. Synthesis of Findings: The mentee will synthesize the findings to identify what forecasting methods are more commonly used and report on the accuracy, robustness, interpretability, and applicability of different forecasting methods in healthcare settings.  This phase will also involve summarizing the strengths and limitations of each approach and providing recommendations for future research.

4. Presentation and Reporting: Finally, the mentee will prepare a manuscript (for journal publication) and presentation (for conference).

My research focuses on developing a comprehensive framework to analyze and predict earthquake damage based on various influencing factors, including ground motion characteristics, soil-structure interaction, and building design parameters. By employing advanced statistical models and machine learning techniques, the study aims to identify patterns and correlations in historical earthquake data to improve damage prediction accuracy.

The research involves conducting detailed case studies, such as the recent Turkey earthquake, where data from field observations, laboratory shake table experiments, and computational simulations are integrated to assess the structural capacity and seismic demands of buildings. This multi-disciplinary approach allows for a holistic understanding of how different factors contribute to building performance during earthquakes.

The outcomes of this research are expected to contribute to the development of more effective building codes and retrofit strategies, ultimately reducing the risk of catastrophic failures in future seismic events. Additionally, the insights gained will aid policymakers and engineers in making informed decisions about urban planning and disaster preparedness, thereby enhancing community resilience against earthquakes.","The primary objective is to develop a comprehensive model correlating earthquake damage patterns with structural resilience metrics. Students will explore concepts such as probabilistic seismic hazard analysis and resilience-based design to create a model predicting structural damage based on seismic input and building characteristics.

Corallines are found in marine environments around the world and are really ecologically important for creating habitat and food resources for marine invertebrates, forming structural support in reef environments and facilitating larval and kelp recruitment. My research has focused on using molecular techniques (RNA Sequencing and gene expression analysis) to understand how these organisms calcify. Additionally, I’ve done lab experiments to understand how calcification and other physiological processes are impacted by climate stressors to predict how these organisms may survive in our future oceans and what effects that could have on the marine organisms that rely on them.  ","If you have the slightest interest in anything to do with seaweeds, I would be happy to mentor you on a project! While my research focuses on coralline algae, the lab I belong to studies everything seaweed, so I have the background knowledge to mentor a project on other types of seaweeds as well. This could include the beautiful bull kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana, you might see biking on the seawall at Stanley Park, the “dried plastic” red algae, Pyropia, commonly found on rocks at low tide in Vancouver or any of the other unique seaweeds. 
General topics that I am interested in include:
1.	How seaweed are going to be impacted and respond to environmental changes related to climate change. For this topic, it is important to consider the effects of multiple stressors (i.e. temperature, pH, light) and consider how other organisms that may rely on seaweed are going to be impacted as well. 
2.	Physiological limits of seaweeds. As our oceans get warmer and more acidic, it is important to understand their physiological limits, the maximum/minimum environmental conditions that they can experience and survive. Seaweeds have different life stages, both macroscopic and microscopic, so it is important to understand how different life stages are impacted by environmental conditions and if parts of the life cycle are more sensitive than others. 
3.	Adaptation and phenotypic plasticity amongst seaweed populations. Local adaptation refers to when a population evolves to have higher fitness in their “home environment” because of constant exposure to the environmental conditions there. However, a population that wasn’t adapted to those conditions would not have as high of fitness. There are lots of interesting questions you can ask about adaptation of seaweed populations to different environmental conditions and how that is important for future climate changes.  

Based on your interest in one of these topics, we would work together to search the literature for research gaps, define research questions, and determine the methodology needed to answer those questions. If interested, we could have journal clubs to facilitate discussions on important and relevant papers, and I would help you become comfortable with reading scientific journals and writing academic science papers. Additionally, my lab consistently goes out to Stanley Park to do field work and depending on the project, there is the potential to go out to the field with us to conduct a survey and learn to ID seaweeds!

While the exact cause is unclear, it is believed to stem from a mix of genetic, environmental, and microbial factors. Notably, disruptions in the gut microbiota, such as decreased diversity and increased pathogenic bacteria, are prevalent in IBD patients and can trigger maladaptive immune responses, leading to chronic inflammation. Recent research has identified the Enterocloster genus as a predictor of IBD in humans, specifically in Crohn’s disease.

Graphs are data structures composed of nodes and edges, where each edge connects a pair of nodes. They are ubiquitous in various fields, such as molecular machine learning (where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges) and transportation map analysis (where junctions are nodes and roads are edges). My goal is to develop more computationally efficient models that can achieve high performance in these domains. By enhancing the efficiency of these models, we can better analyze complex networks and improve applications in areas like chemistry, transportation, and more.","Traffic forecasting is an interesting application of learning on graphs. Every time you search for a destination on Google Maps, it predicts traffic on different roads, estimates travel time on each candidate route, and proposes the best choices for you. The best route can vary by the time of day, day of the week, or even the month. A mistake in the prediction can leave you stuck in heavy traffic, wasting your precious time.

The amount of traffic on a road for the next hour depends on many other connected roads. Knowledge of the map and the state of traffic changes over the past few hours are all indicators that can help with the prediction process.

My name is Kathleen. I am in my first year of graduate studies and my thesis is on developing a molecular identification tool to reliably and accurately identify 5 species of click beetles which are major agricultural pests in British Columbia. Damage from the larvae of click beetles (known as wireworms) creates unmarketable produce. However, not all click beetles are pests, and many species play beneficial roles by preying on other insect pests, or decomposing plant tissue. Currently, field surveying and management of pest wireworms is limited by the ability to accurately identify and distinguish between coexisting pest and non-pest species. Accurate identification requires advanced expertise and time for accurate identifications, as many species are known to be difficult to differentiate. These challenges have resulted in growers excessively using pesticides for wireworm control, regardless of the presence or economic levels of pest species. The use of pesticides brings major negative environmental consequences, human health concerns and high expenses for growers. Having a tool that is able to identify and quantify species present in agricultural fields would provide growers with the data they need to generate effective wireworm management decisions and help reduce unnecessary pesticide applications.","Although I am currently working on developing molecular identification tools for click beetles. I have also conducted other research within the large world of entomology and pest management - including working with pheromone development, invasive species, and biological control.

Excitons, formed as electron-hole pairs when a photon hits a molecule, can exist in either singlet or triplet spin states. Singlet excitons decay radiatively, generating power, while triplet excitons typically don’t radiate due to spin selection rules, resulting in wasted energy.

Recent advances in non-fullerene OSCs have shown that controlling triplet recombination can significantly boost efficiency. My approach in fullerene OSCs involves hybridizing the spin Hamiltonian within a tight-binding Hubbard model. By integrating this with ab initio Bethe-Salpeter and Dyson’s equations, I’m modeling the behavior of excitons and their spin interactions in these materials. Using Dyson’s equation, I’m connecting unperturbed and perturbed Green’s functions throughout the lattice, which helps in understanding how exciton dynamics are affected by spin interactions.

This ongoing work aims to uncover new mechanisms for reducing triplet recombination in fullerene OSCs, with the goal of making them more efficient and moving them closer in performance to silicon-based solar cells, while retaining their advantages of flexibility, low cost, and durability.","As a mentor, I would guide my mentees in exploring the fascinating world of organic solar cells (OSCs) with a focus on improving their efficiency by tackling the challenges posed by triplet exciton recombination.

The key objective of this project would be to develop new strategies to reduce energy losses in fullerene-based OSCs by controlling and mitigating triplet exciton recombination. The mentees would be introduced to spin Hamiltonian theory and tight-binding Hubbard models. They would then use these tools to study the spin interactions of excitons in organic materials.

I have over 5 years of experience in this field, having completed my PhD in August 2023 and moving to Canada in October 2023 as a postdoctoral fellow. My research focuses on: prostate cancer dormancy (remission) and therapy resistance. There are two main types of therapy resistance in prostate cancer: androgen receptor-driven castration resistant prostate cancer and treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Within these areas I explore the mechanism of the cancer and investigate novel therapies to combat the disease. My research is mainly lab-focused with some simple bioinformatics analysis.

","Hi mentees! Here I propose a research project in the field of prostate cancer. However I am open to other projects if you have a passion for a certain area in cancer research and will do my best to guide your project to the best of my ability. 

The proposed project:
Some preliminary data from another student has demonstrated that IL-33 is upregulated during the dormancy stage of prostate cancer. The dormancy stage is often known as the 'remission' stage where treatments have been effective and most of the cancer cells have died, however a small sub-population of those cells are in a senescent/quiescent stage until resistance mechanisms occur (relapse). IL-33 is a cytokine with a varied role in different diseases and we believe it not only has immune functions in prostate cancer but potentially a gene modulatory role. The tumour immune microenvironment is a relatively new area of study within cancer research. Particularly, prostate cancer is known to be a 'cold' tumour with limited (but still some) immune activation, making whatever immune processes that ARE occurring important to the cancer progression.

Your research project will be exploring the mechanism of IL-33 in prostate cancer, with a focus on the dormancy state. I will guide you through the process of developing a research plan, deliberation and execution of experiments, data analysis and report writing. Unfortunately, you will not be able to perform the lab work but I will explain the techniques and give you the data to analyse. Further data can be supplied using large patient datasets. 

What I expect from you: dedication to the project, critical thinking, good communication and enthusiasm.
What I will offer in return: project support, facilitating your personal and professional development, expertise in scientific techniques, scientific writing support, development of literature searching skills.

I look forward to working with you!

leading cause of cancer deaths in Canada. Many individuals with PDAC also experience comorbid conditions like diabetes and insulin resistance, leading to elevated insulin levels in the body. There is growing evidence that increased insulin can make PDAC more aggressive and faster-growing. However, the precise mechanisms by which insulin affects PDAC are not well understood. It is important to understand what insulin does to PDAC cells and whether it needs to be controlled in the patients because current clinical practice does not consider patients’ insulin, nor glucose, levels during treatment unless it impedes their ability to receive treatment. My research aims to improve the current understanding of the interaction between insulin and PDAC, potentially providing the scientific rationale for controlling insulin levels during treatment.","Mentees will begin by conducting a literature review in the field of pancreatic cancer or cancer more broadly to identify their specific research interests. Following this, they will formulate their research questions and hypotheses, and design experiments to propose a theoretical research project. For those who are interested in pancreatic cancer or its metabolism but do not have a clear research idea, I can provide some of my own ideas, and we can collaborate to develop them into a full theoretical project.

I interrogate the notion of abrupt Late Bronze Age collapse by examining how archaeology can detect climate change through bioarchaeological, paleoenviornmental, and material culture data. I overlay this archaeological information with modern ethnographic refugee research to illuminate gaps in current understandings of the movement of ancient non-free people (enslaved, captives, mercenaries).

I’m an MA student studying the archaeology of Late Bronze Age (1600-1100 BCE) human mobility and migration within the Eastern Mediterranean/Ancient Near East.

If you, too, are interested in the impact of a specific historical event and want experience combining ideas and research from various disciplines, then I might be the perfect mentor for you!

Since my research and field are inherently very interdisciplinary, I welcome projects that draw on various fields for their methodologies and/or data. I prefer to co-develop a project with students that begins with a broader theme and narrows into a concise research question based on available data. My disciplines’ research tends to be very creative (think: the influence of laughing in the Roman world). I’m here to support your interest, as it’s much easier to research something you genuinely care about rather than forcing a research question. I believe that the stronger a research question, the more concise and influential the research, so we will dedicate time at the beginning of the process to developing a well-rounded question.

My goal is to help students understand and execute every step of a research project, such as:

1. Brainstorming topics
2. Formulating a research question
3. Literature review 
4. Data collection
5. Argument formation
6. Writing process
7. Revision process
8. Create abstract/poster/conference-style presentation to present final project.

Through these general steps, I will ensure you have the tools to execute future projects and a well-rounded understanding of the multi-disciplinary nature of humanities research to excel in graduate school or any other post-grad plans.

Shorebirds undertake some of the longest migrations in the world, and many populations are currently in decline due to increasing threats related to global warming, sea level rise, and other human impacts. To aid the conservation of these species, my research has two main goals: (1) examine the effects of multiple stressors on habitat for migratory shorebirds along the west coast of North America and (2) prioritize conservation actions to preserve these species and their habitats in the face of future climate change. This is accomplished through a mix of both quantitative and qualitative methods, including approaches such as spatial analysis in GIS, statistical modelling, and conservation decision science. Although my current focus is shorebirds and coastal wetlands, my research interests are fairly diverse within the fields of ecology and conservation, and I have also conducted research on coral reefs in the central Pacific, songbirds in Ontario, and pufferfish in the Bahamas.

Given the diversity of analytical methods used in ecology and conservation and the increasing accessibility of ecological and environmental datasets, there are many potential directions that your research project could go. Possible avenues include the following:

•	Conducting a systematic review to better understand the past research on a particular topic and synthesizing this information to draw new conclusions (e.g., the impacts of storm flooding on beach-nesting shorebirds, the impacts of heat stress on coral reef fish populations)
•	Analyzing spatial data to identify regions/sites that we should prioritize for conservation to help preserve a particular species
•	Developing a proposal for field research that could potentially be conducted in the future as part of a summer internship or as a graduate project

This will lead to important applications in genetics (large P) for instance. We can either utilize more efficient data structures in C++ and GPU for this speedup or we can develop more efficient approximate computation methods with techniques such as recursions. 

2. Develop a mathematical theory of Dempster-Shafer theory (advanced math or statistics background required)

Despite working very well in practice, Dempster-Shafer theory has yet to realize its theoretical connection to the mechanism of Bayesian inference and other mainstream inference theory. We will work on a better mathematically understanding of Dempster-Shafer theory and illustrate why it works better. For instance, what kind of convergence guarantee does it provide and what kind of geometric / topological space does it operate on.

Although the method is very successful in patients with lymphoma and leukemia, the manufacturing of the CAR T-cells is very complex, and the overall treatment costs may surpass $1,000,000 USD. 

My research focuses on alternative CAR T-cell generation methods to sidestep the current manufacturing hurdles and generate a more accessible alternative for lymphoma and leukemia patients. Several groups including our group is exploring RNA carrying lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) capable of modifying T-cells directly in the body. However, the current mRNA designs are tailored for vaccines that facilitate short-term robust expression. This may prove insufficient to generate a strong and sustained anti-tumor response. As an alternative, I am exploring novel RNA formats: circular RNA (circRNA) that can resist degradation in cells and self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) that can make more copies of itself. With these formats, we expect to maximize both generation and duration of CAR T-cells in a patient with lower and fewer doses of RNA. 
","To the mentees: if my work with CAR T-cells and RNA-LNP technologies interest you, let’s work together! This field is a rapidly growing area with so many questions still unanswered that we can take it whichever direction that interests the group.

- How can we make CAR encoding RNA-LNPs more specific to the T-cells? 
- What are some alternative strategies to increase expression profile? 
- Can we leverage these technologies to tackle solid tumors with CAR T-cells? 
- Can be combine this technology with other successful therapies for better responses? 
- Would the alternative RNA formats also work for other conditions like auto-immune diseases? 

I value our collective time and experience above all, so we will mostly decide on the workflow together. As a rough guideline, our initial meetings will consist of general discussions on CAR T-cells and RNA-LNP technologies, focusing on the current challenges. We will then come up with our research question accordingly and devise the appropriate methodology through literature reviews. Finally, we will predict the likely outcomes and potential shortfalls of our proposed design.

My current study is about thyroid disease classification and segmentation from scintigraphy images. 

Thyroid diseases affect millions of people worldwide, including many Canadians, leading to conditions like hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism. Accurately diagnosing these conditions is crucial for effective treatment, but the process can be complex, time-consuming, and prone to errors. Current diagnostic methods rely heavily on the manual interpretation of medical images, which can vary depending on the experience of the physician. My research aims to change this by developing advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools that can automatically analyze thyroid images and provide fast, accurate diagnoses.

Using AI, we can extract detailed information from medical images that might be difficult for the human eye to detect. This technology will help doctors differentiate between various thyroid conditions more reliably, reducing the likelihood of misdiagnosis and ensuring that patients receive the correct treatment sooner. Additionally, by automating the analysis process, we can save valuable time for healthcare professionals, allowing them to focus more on patient care.

Ultimately, this research will contribute to improving the quality of life for patients by making thyroid disease diagnosis more accurate, efficient, and accessible. It will also reduce the burden on the healthcare system by streamlining diagnostic processes and potentially lowering healthcare costs.

These amino acids play crucial roles in tumor growth by providing the building blocks for cell division, including nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, while also supporting redox homeostasis. In cancer, many non-essential amino acids become ""conditionally essential"" when their demand surpasses supply, leading to increased interest in targeting amino acid uptake and metabolism as potential cancer treatments.
Alanine, a non-essential amino acid, is key for protein synthesis and serves as a fuel source for lipogenesis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and the synthesis of other amino acids. Stable-isotope tracing reveals alanine as a vital carbon and nitrogen source for metabolic pathways in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and leukemia. Inhibiting the membrane transporter SLC38A2, which facilitates alanine uptake, reduces PDAC tumor growth and can even result in complete regression in mice. PDAC cells acquire alanine from external sources or through de novo synthesis, making it challenging to understand its role in tumor metabolism. My research aims to explore how targeting alanine depletion could cause metabolic stress in PDAC cells and tumors, potentially revealing new therapeutic strategies for treating PDAC and other cancer types.
","
My research focuses on developing enzyme tools to study dysregulated nutrients in cancer cells, with a particular emphasis on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the deadliest cancers with a low survival rate. Specifically, I am investigating the traditionally classified “non-essential” amino acid, alanine, which has been found to have an upregulated transporter in PDAC. I have developed an enzyme system that selectively depletes alanine, allowing me to uncover its metabolic role in cancer. Additionally, this enzyme system holds potential as a therapeutic tool, as it depletes alanine, and I have shown that it causes growth defects in PDAC cells.
For the mentorship program, I would like to expand this project to explore other cancer types, particularly in relation to alanine metabolism and its transporters. This provides an excellent opportunity for students who are interested in cancer biology and metabolic research. There is a wealth of sequenced data available on various cancer types, much of which has yet to be explored in the context of alanine metabolism. Together, we can utilize these existing cancer databases to generate novel scientific research that could lead to publications in scientific journals and the potential development of new therapeutic targets.
The project timeline would be structured to ensure a thorough and rewarding research experience. Initially, we would focus on building a strong foundation in cancer biology and bioinformatics, particularly in data mining and analysis of large-scale cancer datasets. Following this, we would develop the experimental design, targeting alanine and its transporters across different cancer types. Midway through the mentorship, we would begin analyzing our findings, identifying key patterns, and developing hypotheses about alanine’s role in other cancers. By the end of the program, we aim to have generated data that could contribute to a publishable manuscript and potentially lead to further therapeutic developments.
Overall, my goal is to guide you through a hands-on research experience, empowering you to think critically, develop technical skills, and contribute meaningfully to cancer research. Whether you’re interested in bioinformatics, lab work, or both, this mentorship will offer you a comprehensive introduction to cancer research while fostering novel scientific discovery.

I am a first-year Master’s student at the Centre for Heart Lung Innovation at. St. Paul’s Hospital. My research focuses on the effect of vaping on the lungs using advanced medical imaging techniques. Specifically, we use an imaging technique called Hyperpolarized 129Xenon Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI); there are only about 20 sites worldwide with this technology. 

Typically, MRI of the lungs is not effective because they are filled with air which provides no signal for MRI to create an image with. However, when a patient inhales Hyperpolarized 129Xenon, it acts as a contrast agent lighting up the lungs wherever it ventilates. This technique is unique because it allows us to regionally visualize and quantify lung function, unlike any other tool. Xenon is also partially biologically soluble, meaning that it acts as a surrogate for oxygen during gas exchange allowing us to measure its signal from when it is inhaled to when it binds to the red blood cells.
Additionally, we also use Computed Tomography (CT) which provides structural information to combine with the functional information provided by MRI, giving us a comprehensive understanding of lung health.
","While my primary research focuses on vaping, we conduct a number of studies that use the same imaging techniques, but investigate a variety of other lung diseases like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and Long Covid. Additionally, there is research that leans more towards the physics of the imaging like optimizing image quality.

I’m open to exploring a variety of projects with mentees and want to pick something that is interesting to everyone. We do have an abundance of data to work with so I’m aiming to go beyond theory and carry out a legitimate experiment to be presented at the Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Conference (MURC) as well as Life Sciences Research Night (LSRN). We can also aim to publish in the Canadian Journal of Undergraduate Research (CJUR). These are valuable opportunities to develop presentation, poster-making, and academic writing skills early in your academic career.

I’d like to take mentees on a lab tour to show them how we acquire the images and where the data originates from. We will also use software like R and SPSS to carry out statistics and create figures (no previous experience necessary) and collaborate to write an abstract to submit to the above conferences. 
General workflow:
1. Initial Meeting: Introduction to Hyperpolarized Xenon-129 MRI
2. Literature Review: Narrow down a research question and gather background information
3. Method Development: Plan how to execute the research (data needed, statistical tests, etc.)
4. Execution: Implement the methods and obtain results.
5. Abstract Submission: Submit to MURC (applications open late fall, conference in March) and LSRN (applications open in fall, conference in mid-November—may 6. present preliminary results given how early it is)
7. Further Analysis: Prepare a poster/presentation and begin drafting a paper for CJUR (no specific deadline)

While this may seem like a lot to accomplish in a short amount of time, we can tailor our plan to meet everyone's expectations and goals. I don’t want this to feel like a stressful group project and we have the flexibility to carry out as much or as little as we want!

Potential research areas:
- Examining a subset of participants who vape, smoke cannabis, or use cigarettes.
- Investigating associations between lung disease in MRI and CT
- Understanding the effect of overinflated or under-inflated lungs on xenon signal in MRI

that kickstart this nerve develop process. Through bioinformatics searches, we’ve identified
several target proteins that have been suggested to be associated with conditions such as autism,

These peptides exhibit antimicrobial activity by embedded themselves in cell membranes, forming pores that can lead to the death of bacteria and other microbes.  For these AMPs to be useful clinically, we must first produce them in large amounts. Isolating these peptides from their original hosts would be much too costly and time consuming.  

Instead, we utilize synthetic biology to “re-program” other organisms to make these compounds for us, much like little cell factories. These recombinant proteins are commonly produced in bacteria, yeast, or mammalian cell lines. In our lab we use of yeast as they are not susceptible to the AMPs like bacteria, but are cheaper to maintain and scale up than mammalian cells.  

Broadly, I work on the optimization of AMP production from yeast. My project specifically looks at utilizing transposons to mutate thousands of genes simultaneously and then using next generation sequencing to link the genotype to phenotype of these mutants. In practice, this will allow us to discover which genes are most important for optimization of AMP production.  ","For my mentee’s research project, I would like for them to write out a plan for the expression of a protein for pharmacological or industrial use. The exact protein they choose for this will be up to them, and what problem they wish to solve with the expression of this protein. For example, they may choose an antimicrobial peptide from an interesting organism, like a cathelicidin from the venom of a given species of snake that could be developed as an antibiotic. Alternatively, they may want to focus on a “green enzymes” like laccase, which can degrade phenolic pollutants and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or lipase which can be used to degrade triglycerols for biofuel production. Antifreeze proteins from arctic fish are recombinantly produced and added to certain foods to improve their texture and shelf life. Enzymes such as amylase and β-glucanase are used in the brewing and winemaking industries. Drugs mimicking natural human peptides are also quite popular, with the blockbuster drug Ozempic being a modified form of hormone glucagon-like peptide-1.  

 

With whatever protein the students chose, they must then work through a plan to express it. There are many possible choices for expression systems, including different species of bacteria, yeast, mammalian cell lines, plants, and even insects. These systems all have their pros and cons, and the student will have to justify their choice as they develop a plan for expression.  

 

What is important with the student’s choice is that this protein/expression system combo is novel. By that I mean I wouldn’t want them to just look at the literature to express something in E.coli and just copying that. Perhaps they try expression in a non-standard species or maybe they can suggest an amino acid change within the protein to improve stability. Overall, this project will give students a chance to plan out a research project and learn more about the use of recombinant proteins in a field of their choice.

PDAC cells have rewired their metabolism to depend on extracellular amino acids, such as alanine, to fuel energy production, outcompeting glucose and glutamine as the major carbon source. PDAC cells have been shown to utilize SLC38A2 (SNAT2), an amino acid transporter protein, to facilitate alanine uptake and sustain their metabolic demands. Previously, it was shown that the genetic deletion of SLC38A2 was sufficient for hindering PDAC cell growth and induced tumour regression in mice. 

In my research, I am interested in understanding how SLC38A2 is regulated post-translationally. The post-translational modifications of proteins allow for complex regulatory mechanisms that can rapidly activate or inactivate protein activity.

In older women, this process is complicated by physiological changes associated with menopause. Menopause causes significant pathological, morphological, and anatomical changes in the cervix, including thinning of the epithelium, decreased cervical mucus production, and a shift in the position of the squamocolumnar junction. These changes can impact the effectiveness of traditional cytology-based screening methods. The atrophic changes in the cervical epithelium can lead to an increase in false-positive results in cytology tests, as atrophic cells may be misinterpreted as abnormal. Additionally, the recession of the squamocolumnar junction into the endocervical canal can make it more challenging to obtain adequate samples for cytology, potentially leading to false-negative results. My research on HPV-based screening in this age group is crucial, as HPV testing may be less affected by these menopausal changes, potentially offering a more reliable screening method for older women. By focusing on this specific population and comparing HPV testing to cytology, my study will provide valuable insights into the most effective screening strategies for detecting cervical cancer in postmenopausal women, thereby addressing a critical aspect of disease pathogenesis and detection in this understudied group.","As a Ph.D. candidate in Epidemiology with extensive experience in public health research, I am excited to guide undergraduate mentees through the research process in the REX program. My goal is to provide a comprehensive introduction to epidemiological research methods and data analysis, with a focus on real-world applications in public health.

The mentorship program will begin with an overview of epidemiology and its importance in addressing public health challenges. We will explore various research methodologies, including study design, data collection techniques, and statistical analysis. Drawing from my experience working with a range of datasets, including administrative health records, clinical trial data, and community-based research studies, I will introduce mentees to the practical aspects of working with diverse health data sources. If needed we will discuss the unique challenges and opportunities presented by research in rural, remote, and underserved populations, including Indigenous communities.

Our project will involve a literature review on a current public health topic, allowing mentees to develop critical thinking skills and gain familiarity with scientific literature. Topics may include infectious disease epidemiology, health disparities, or preventive health strategies, depending on the interests of the group.

Mentees will learn to formulate research questions and hypotheses, design a study methodology, and plan for data analysis. I will provide guidance on using statistical software such as SPSS, STATA, or R, tailoring the instruction to the mentees' skill levels. We will also discuss the ethical considerations in public health research and the importance of community engagement, particularly when working with diverse and potentially vulnerable populations.

Throughout the program, I will share insights from my experiences in diverse research settings, from rural Bangladesh to Canadian communities. This will help mentees understand the global context of public health research and the importance of cultural competence in epidemiology.

The project will culminate in a mini research proposal or a data analysis report, which mentees will present in a format similar to an academic conference. This exercise will help develop their scientific writing and presentation skills, crucial for future academic pursuits.

By the end of the program, mentees will have gained practical experience in epidemiological research methods, data analysis, and scientific communication.

During my undergraduate studies, I worked extensively on optimizing bacteriophage treatments for combating Salmonellosis in the poultry industry and spent over 20 months researching antimicrobial peptides. My interests lie in the intersection of bioinformatics, genomic data analysis, and data visualization, where I aim to uncover insights that can contribute to public health.
My research interests revolve around understanding the genetic mechanisms that drive antimicrobial resistance, particularly in pathogens producing various carbapenemase enzymes. I am passionate about using bioinformatics tools to analyze genomic data and create visualizations that clearly convey complex scientific findings.
The project I propose will expand on existing research by comparing the resistome profiles of bacterial isolates encoding various carbapenemase enzymes. We will investigate whether these organisms exhibit distinct resistance gene profiles and explore the co-occurrence of antibiotic resistance classes. This work is important because it addresses the growing global issue of AMR, which poses a significant threat to public health. By enhancing our understanding of these resistance mechanisms, this project could inform more effective strategies for combating drug-resistant infections.
The project will involve a combination of computational analysis and literature review. We will use bioinformatics tools like AMRFinderPlus and PLASMe to identify and annotate AMR genes and resistance mechanisms in bacterial genomes. The data analysis will be conducted using R, where we will perform resistome analysis and co-occurrence studies to uncover patterns in the genomic data.

As a new graduate student, I have not specified my area of research, but can discuss my areas of interest! One of these areas is gender and politics. I am interested in pursuing research that looks at gender from an intersectional perspective and analyzing the ways in which gender interacts with different aspects of identity. I am also interested in problems of representation, as well as historical and systemic injustices. I have conducted previous research in care-related politics, specifically, the politics and policies of the welfare state surrounding the assistance (or lack thereof) provided to sole support and marginalized mothers. My main point of analysis in this research was around the social conception of motherhood and the dangerous expectations which it perpetuates. 

Another area of political research that interests me is comparative politics. I have explored gender and politics through a comparative lens, but also different issues and topics such as government regime types (e.g., authoritarianism) and global conflict management tactics, such as partitions (i.e., the division of a single state or colony and the creation of new international boundaries). I am also eager to study the dynamics of political attitudes and ideological leanings; how they interplay with the issues relating to gender and politics, but also through the lens of an analysis of extremism and polarization.

They can't flee from danger or chase down food like animals. Instead, they must adapt, anticipate challenges, and optimize growth, all while remaining immobile.  A critical part of this adaptive strategy is cellulose, the most abundant polymer on Earth. Cellulose forms the backbone of cell walls, giving plants the rigidity to grow toward light, withstand the elements, and resist pathogens. Yet, despite its importance, our understanding of cellulose biosynthesis (CB) remains incomplete.

Enter COBRA, a protein found to be critical for CB in Arabidopsis thaliana. Null COBRA mutants (cob-4) result in misoriented cellulose microfibrils (CMFs) and isotropic expansion, leading to seedling lethality. Since cob-4 can't be studied beyond germination, researchers use conditional mutants to explore how COBRA becomes misregulated. The cob-1 mutant, caused by a single point mutation, leads to root swelling only when seedlings are grown on high sucrose media. This finding is surprising because COBRA and sucrose were not previously linked to the same pathways. Since sucrose can break down into glucose, a building block for cellulose, it prompts the question: Is COBRA more directly involved in cellulose synthesis than merely orienting it? The ball is just beginning to roll, and with COBRA being present in every plant, unlocking its secrets will profoundly impact the future of all plant research.
","The primary objective of the REX project is to understand the mechanism that triggers the phenotypes observed in two COBRA mutants, cob-1 and hulk-1. Previously, it was believed that the root swelling phenotype in cob-1 was induced solely by high sucrose concentrations. However, recent findings suggest that glucose and sorbitol can also produce similar phenotypic effects. One straightforward approach to explore this question is to vary the chemical composition of the growth media and assess the responses of both wild-type and mutant lines. Additionally, screening COBRA mutants with chemical libraries could reveal previously unobserved phenotypes, guiding further investigations into the molecular pathways COBRA might influence, which have not been considered yet. This is how we found that Pepstatin A, an aspartyl protease inhibitor, can rescue the cob-1 phenotype when grown on high sucrose - A phenomenon we are also trying to understand. For those more interested in a computational/bioinformatic approach, we can work to investigate COBRA’s phylogeny and molecular dynamics through software like Alphafold3, GROMACs, and more.

Students can choose to work on individual projects or collaborate on group projects. They will gain hands-on wet-lab research experience in a biochemistry setting and develop skills transferable to other disciplines such as chemistry and medicine. Students will receive training in essential laboratory techniques, including buffer and media preparation from scratch, autoclaving, sterile technique, working in a flow hood, plating seeds on media, conducting root growth assays to quantify changes, and using bioinformatics for data analysis. There is also the possibility of incorporating advanced techniques like PCR, qPCR, and RT-qPCR, depending on the direction of your project.

You are encouraged to use the laboratory and its facilities to conduct your experiments at your own pace. By the end of the program, you will have concrete results to present at the MURC conference. Even if everyone opts for individual projects, they will naturally complement each other since they all focus on COBRA. This structure will foster a collaborative environment where students can support each other in troubleshooting and brainstorming, similar to a grad school environment.

However, many people who use drugs have trouble accessing effective pain management due to stigma, a lack of evidence-based treatments, and socio-economic barriers to effective therapies. A complex and often neglected issue, the undertreatment of pain among people who use unregulated opioids is common, and often leads to self-management of pain via the toxic drug supply. This carries risks of overdose amidst BC’s ongoing toxic drug crisis, which has caused devastating loss of life across the province. Overdose deaths from toxic drugs represent the leading cause of death among British Columbians aged 10 to 59.

Current pathogenesis models suggest that HRS cells recruit immune cells to the tumor microenvironment (TME) to form a well-organized tumor-supporting niche. Although the treatment of primary cHL has improved significantly, approximately 20-30% of cHL patients experience relapse or refractory disease. However, the composition and function of the TME in relapsed cHL are not well understood, which makes it challenging to develop effective therapies for these patients, and absence of reliably predictive biomarkers at the time of relapse hampers the development and deployment of more effective interventions. Therefore, understanding the complex interplay between tumor cells and the TME in relapsed cHL is critically needed for developing more effective therapies for patients with relapsed cHL.My research aim to characterize at single cell resolution the differences in tumor microenvironment (TME) biology between diagnostic and relapsed cHL, before and after treatment with standard of care polychemotherapy (ABVD).","The field of single-cell technologies is rapidly advancing, with ongoing improvements focused on enhancing resolution, throughput, and the ability to capture more detailed aspects of cellular biology. Unlike traditional bulk analyses, which average data from thousands or millions of cells, single-cell technologies enable the examination of cellular diversity within a population, providing insights into individual cells' unique characteristics and behaviours.

Recent technological progress has significantly improved our ability to generate high-throughput single-cell gene expression data, leading to a rapid expansion of publicly available single-cell datasets. However, single-cell data often comes from multiple experiments, with variations in factors such as capture times, personnel, reagent batches, equipment, and even the technology platforms used. These differences can introduce substantial variability, or batch effects, which can obscure the biological differences of interest during data integration. Therefore, effective removal of batch effects is crucial.

Currently, several methods exist for integrating single-cell datasets, including Seurat, Harmony, and FastMNN. However, the choice of batch correction algorithm can result in significantly different corrected datasets, making it essential to benchmark these integration methods to provide an unbiased guide for selecting the appropriate method.

But when tiger numbers started dwindling the government set up a Task Force to reevaluate tiger conservation polices in 2006. The Task Force found out that the alienation of local communities due to conservation policies was the main reason tiger conservation was failing. Various tribes living in these forests have coexisted with tigers for hundreds of years and tiger worship and nature worship are part of their culture. I am collaborating with forest dwelling communities in central India to study their forest management practices, their relationship with tigers, and their role in conservation.
While communities are still being relocated to create inviolate spaces for tigers, the Forest Rights Act (2006) gives communities the opportunity to claim Community Forest Resource Rights (CFR) over their traditional forests. Recognition of CFR rights empowers them to take the lead in tiger conservation while securing sustainable livelihoods. Elinor Ostrom demonstrated that communities can develop sustainable management practices under specific conditions and identified the necessary design principles that had to be met. I am applying these design principles to evaluate the effectiveness of management practices developed by these communities.","There is a growing global consensus that local communities play a pivotal role in the success of conservation initiatives. Research indicates that fostering sustainable livelihoods can promote conservation efforts while preserving traditional knowledge and cultural practices, often referred to as the ""enterprise conservation model.""

Understanding the impacts of these changes and identifying strategies to harness their potential is crucial.

Bumble bees must have access to sufficient forage throughout their active season, starting in the spring through to the end of summer. Pollen collected from foraging is a significant source of protein for bumble bees and is used exclusively to feed developing larvae. Bumble bees forage on a variety of different plants found across their habitat, visiting many different species per flight.

Researchers interested in investigating the foraging habits and nutritional requirements of bumble bees must identify the pollen collected by bumble bees. A single bumble bee can collect millions of pollen grains in a single flight. Identifying pollen requires expert knowledge of the specific species morphology of pollen and often hours of work identifying hundreds of pollen grains per sample. However, knowledge of what different species of flowers bumble bees visit will inform conservation efforts to ensure that bumble bees have access to consistent reliable and plentiful forage throughout their active periods. Developing the entomological methods to quickly assess pollinator foraging choice through computational identification machine learning will be a vital tool for researchers. ","Using the UBC Farm in the summer of 2021, we established seventeen 50m transects in various habitats, such as production fields, hedgerows, and floral strips. For each sampling session held every two weeks from May to September, we netted bumble bees and the pollen was collected from the bee corbicula to assess what pollens were collected. High-quality microscopic photos were taken using UBC’s Bioimaging Facility (BIF lab) for over 400 bumble bee pollen samples.

The neuronal tissue engineering lab’s research line, which is the focus of this REX program,  aims at developing a 3D model of the human brain suitable for the study of neurodegenerative disorders, i.e. AD and FTD, by combining 3D bioprinting and hiPSC. 

","I am a postdoctoral fellow in neuronal tissue engineering and I hold a PhD in Neuroscience with a specialization in neurodegenerative disorders. My research interests include developing novel brain models that facilitate our understanding of the molecular basis of neurodegenerative disorders, with a particular interest in Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

To achieve this goal, our laboratory differentiates human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into the main brain cell types and incorporates them into biocompatible materials, referred to as “bioinks”. Using a 3D bioprinter, the bioink is deposited in a layer-by-layer fashion to design a 3D model of the brain cortex.

At first, our laboratory optimized a 3D-bioprinting brain model using hiPSC cortical neurons and astrocytes derived from healthy control subjects. The next step, which is the focus of the REX program, will consist of inducing the AD phenotype in our current 3D brain models. 

This step will require an initial phase of conceptualization based on AD literature review, brainstorming, and discussion. Students will be asked to identify possible research strategies to achieve the project aim and they will be supported in developing critical and analytical thinking.

Creativity and original thinking will also play a key role in the student’s activities. Students will be asked to propose ideas on how to exploit or maximize the features of the 3D bioprinter within and outside of the current project.

Finally, for those interested in further advancing the project in the wet lab, students will be provided with the opportunity to assist and be part of many of the below-listed lab activities:

•	Culturing and differentiation of hiPSC into cortical neurons, astrocytes, and microglia.
•	Bioprinting of hiPSC derived cells into 3D neuronal models.
•	Characterization of 2D and 3D cell culture electrophysiology (calcium imaging), transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq), histology (confocal microscopy immunofluorescence), and biochemistry (Western blot, ELISA).
•	Performing quality control procedures on instruments including related statistical analysis of data quality.
